# Self Taught Computer Science

The purpose of this plan is to provide a solid path for a practicing engineer seeking to deepen his/her understanding of the computer science that underlie their work. 

If you're came here to learn some language then you came to the wrong place. There are plenty of fine tutorials out there that you can refer to for this. 

On the other hand, if you're here because you want to take your working knowledge to a whole new level and because you've always been fascinated by the 
underlying principles that make computers work both on the hardware and software level then you came to the right place.
