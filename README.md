# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This is a course in programming.

It is based on Berkley's course delivered in Spring 2011 of the same name.

The target audience are serious programmers looking to advance their knowledge beyond some specific  language or technology.

The course itself is based on the highly acclaimed [SICP ](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871) book,  considered by many to be one of the most important Computer Science books ever written.
